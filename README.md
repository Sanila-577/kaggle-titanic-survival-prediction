# Titanic Survival Prediction Project ðŸš¢

This project is a machine learning model developed to predict passenger survival on the Titanic using Kaggle's dataset. It involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, and testing various algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.

## Key Features
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Handling missing data, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing features.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualized relationships between features to uncover survival patterns.
- **Feature Engineering:** Created new features from existing data (e.g., family size, title extraction) to improve predictions.
- **Model Building:** Implemented multiple models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
- **Additional Ensemble Approaches:** Applied ensemble methods like Gradient Boosting and Voting Classifier to improve overall model accuracy.
- **Model Evaluation:** Compared models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and cross-validation techniques.
